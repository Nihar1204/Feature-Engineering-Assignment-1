    "Lack of Consideration for Feature Interactions: The Filter method evaluates features independently of each other and the target variable. This means that it does not take into account potential interactions between features that could collectively contribute to predictive power. Features that are individually weak might become strong predictors when combined with other features.\n",
    "Limited to Statistical Metrics: Filter methods typically rely on statistical metrics like correlation, variance, and information gain. These metrics might not capture complex relationships or domain-specific knowledge that could influence feature relevance. This can result in the selection or elimination of features that might be important from a domain perspective.\n",
    "No Model-Specific Insights: The Filter method does not provide insights into how the selected features will perform with a specific machine learning algorithm. It doesn't take into account the behavior and requirements of the model being used, potentially leading to suboptimal feature selections for that particular algorithm.\n",
